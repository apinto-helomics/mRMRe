- Address all issues conveyed via FIXME statements
- Barcode and Likelihood
- Remove usade of data as a variable
- Standardize object rappers ('mRMR.data' is the wrapper for 'mRMRe.Data'. What is the logic behind?)
- Implement the causality inference methods for both mRMRe.Network and .Filter classes
- Implement the post-filtering methods for both mRMRe.Network and .Filter classes based on MI or causality coefficients
- Implement more functions to existing S4 classes (especially mRMRe.Network)
	- Compute Likelihood
	- Linear Regression Models??
- Revise R code for imperfections and inefficiencies
- Determine multi-threading and -process issues
- Finish documentation
- Vignettes
