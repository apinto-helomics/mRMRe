- Barcode and Likelihood
- Remove usage of data as a variable
- Standardize object rappers ('mRMR.data' is the wrapper for 'mRMRe.Data'. What is the logic behind?)
- Implement more functions to existing S4 classes (especially mRMRe.Network)
	- Compute Likelihood
	- Linear Regression Models??
- Revise R code for imperfections and inefficiencies
- MPI
- Finish documentation
- Vignettes

- I find weird that 'solutions()' returns a list with one item; why not a vector or matrix directly? Why a list?
- The order of solutions should be reversed, the top indices should be the most relevant ones. Currently the last ones are the first selected by the method
