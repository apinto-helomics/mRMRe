BHK:

Fix the following bugs:


# This is not a bug, you are requesting a seed of 1000 indices with a layer 1, this means that it will process the mRMRe on the 1000 features
# and try to expand on those.  In this particular case, it will expand on the 1000 mRMRe but the cgps_ge dataset has 1000 features.
# This causes the 1st layer to be empty as all possible features already have been processed.
1) Too many target_indices
> data(cgps)
> dd <- mRMR.data(data=data.frame(cgps_ge))
> netw <- new("mRMRe.Network", data=dd, target_indices=1:1000, levels = c(10, 1, 1, 1, 1), layers = 1)
Error in sum(sapply(target_indices, function(index) index < 1 || index >  : 
  invalid 'type' (list) of argument

# Same scenario as the previous "bug".  The network has processed all 1000 features after only a couple of layers, therefore
# the list of features to process is empty.
2) Too many layers
> data(cgps)
> dd <- mRMR.data(data=data.frame(cgps_ge))
> netw <- new("mRMRe.Network", data=dd, target_indices=1:10, levels = c(10, 1, 1, 1, 1), layers = 1000)
Error in sum(sapply(target_indices, function(index) index < 1 || index >  : 
  invalid 'type' (list) of argument

3) mi_threshold is not working:
> data(cgps)
> dd <- mRMR.data(data=data.frame(cgps_ge))
> netw <- new("mRMRe.Network", data=dd, target_indices=1:10, levels = c(10, 1, 1, 1, 1), layers = 3, mi_threshold=0.33)
Error in if (sum(sapply(target_indices, function(index) index < 1 || index >  : 
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

4) Too many solutions:
> data(cgps)
> dd <- mRMR.data(data=data.frame(cgps_ge))
> netw <- new("mRMRe.Network", data=dd, target_indices=1:10, levels = c(100, 1, 1, 1, 1), layers = 3)
Error in sum(sapply(target_indices, function(index) index < 1 || index >  : 
  invalid 'type' (list) of argument




Stuff to fix:

- I do not understand what MIM with frequency is actually computing. Try this piece of code:
> data(cgps)
> ge <- mRMR.data(data=data.frame(cgps_ge))
> rr <- mim(object=ges[[i]], continuous_estimator="frequency", method="cor")
> hist(rr)
The scale of the estimations is between -3 and 4 what does not make any sense to me.

- barcode and likelihood:  these functions still require to be fully integrated in the package. Simon, when do you think you'll get the chance to do it?

- you should not use the variable data in R as this function already exists

- I do not fully understand your standards when you build wrappers. For instance 'mRMR.data' is the wrapper for 'mRMRe.Data'. What is the logic behind?
