::Math
	Stratify Cramer's V
    Split Concordance Index (please get rid of timeswitch!)
    Figure out how to use Fisher's Transformation

::Tree
    mRMR score caching in tree

FOOD FOR THOUGHT
    ::Data use of NAs... any good? What if the value *is* NA? Is
    it worth creating a matrix of boolean variables to address this
    issue? Probably not.
    
CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
    I can't get Cramer's V to output anything. Debug it vigorously.
    I never got it to work, it keeps on returning NAs. (Which makes all
    the threads attempt to recompute it, not a big deal but see "food
    for thought")

ALSO
	Please test everything. Spearman, Survival C-Index,
	Continuous VS Discrete C-Index, Cramer's.

NOTES
	Always always look at other routines, especially in ::Math
	to see the order and name of arguments; try to stay as close
	as possible to what we already have
