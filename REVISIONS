Priorities

(1) Refactor R objects and routines. Figure out an appropriate naming
    convention for these.

(2) Implement and wrap resampled ensemble feature selection.

(3) Provide documentation for all public methods.

  (a) Man pages

  (b) Vignette

(4) Update the article to reflect these changes.

  (a) Regenerate (and document) experiments discussed (with the resampled
      ensemble feature selection.)

  (b) Stability and diversity studies.

  (c) Resolve the feature # vs solution length debacle.

Would be awesome to have

(*) Try to solve compiler issues with the package. I propose that we avoid
    hard-coding any hacks and that we instead provide the user with tips in
    the Installation section of the vignette (I have thought of several hacks
    that could mitigate the issues we've been experiencing). 

(*) A Nobel prize for our awesome work.

Luxury (move to the section above if deemed necessary)

( ) Sit down and think really hard about how sample weighing and stratification
    is implemented for measuring association between features.

( ) Improve, automate and integrate the workflow.

  ( ) Bug-tracking system. (JIRA?)

  ( ) Unit, integrative and systems testing

( ) Document internal C++ code.
